# AWS 

**1. EC2**

    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.
    Amazon EC2 provides the following high-level features:
    **Instances**
    Virtual servers.
    
    **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**
    Preconfigured templates for your instances that package the components you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software).
    
    **Instance types**
    Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and graphics hardware for your instances.
    
    **Amazon EBS volumes**
    Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).
    
    **Instance store volumes**
    Storage volumes for temporary data that is deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance.
    
    **Key pairs**
    Secure login information for your instances. AWS stores the public key and you store the private key in a secure place.
    **
    Security groups**
    A virtual firewall that allows you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP ranges to which your instances can connect.
